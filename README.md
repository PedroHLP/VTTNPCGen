## Usage

### General Usage

A new button should've been added to the bottom of the Actors tab named Generate NPC. This button opens a window where you can select what you want to include in the generation. If you're satisfied with your generation, click Accept to save the NPC to a NPC sheet.

### Custom Data

It is possible to import custom data into the generator. The data get's loaded from JSON. In the settings there is an option to open a JSON editor where you can add your own entries. For some formatting examples you can look at [__Examples__](https://github.com/ardittristan/VTTNPCGen/blob/master/examples.md), or double click on a tab in the editor to see the default data.

If you don't want to use the default data but only your custom data. You can toggle the default data on and off at the bottom of the editor.
